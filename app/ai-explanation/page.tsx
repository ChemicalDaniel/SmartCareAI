      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Detailed AI Explanation</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The AI analysis is based on various factors including your vital signs, recent health trends, and medical
        history. Here's a detailed breakdown of the observations and recommendations:
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Blood Pressure</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your blood pressure has remained stable over the past few months, which is a positive sign. The AI considers
        this a good trend because consistent blood pressure within the normal range reduces the risk of cardiovascular
        issues.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Cholesterol Levels</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        There has been a slight increase in your cholesterol levels. While this increase is minor, the AI flags this as
        a warning to monitor closely. This recommendation is based on the potential long-term effects of elevated
        cholesterol on cardiovascular health.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Exercise Routine</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The AI notes that you've maintained a consistent exercise routine, which is excellent for overall health.
        Regular physical activity contributes to better cardiovascular health, weight management, and mental wellbeing.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Blood Sugar</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Minor fluctuations in blood sugar levels have been observed. While these fluctuations are within an acceptable
        range, the AI suggests monitoring this trend. Stable blood sugar levels are important for preventing diabetes
        and other metabolic disorders.
